# Find The Beat Android App

### Introducing findthebeat
This app tries to solve a struggle- the struggle of finding local live music. In many smaller towns (with lesser known bands) the pub/bar websites are a mess to navigate and even less consistent. Enter findthebeat. Findthebeat navigates the websites of every available pub/bar for you, and displays the information regarding live music effectively. The app's database is updated frequently so you never miss a beat.

### Prerequisites
All you simply need is Python 3 or greater and Kivy 1.10.0 or greater (a Python library), or find the app on the Google Play store (not released yet). The following is for running on a Windows machine.

### Installing
